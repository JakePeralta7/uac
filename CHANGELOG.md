# Changelog

## 3.0.0-rc1 (2024-07-23)

### Features

- UAC now completely skips an artifact file (YAML) that has no artifacts to be collected for the target operating system. You can use '--artifacts list [OPERATING_SYSTEM]' to display artifacts for a specific operating system only.
- New output file formats:
  - none: Collected data will not be archived or compressed. Instead, it will be copied directly to an output directory ([#188](https://github.com/tclahr/uac/issues/188)).
  - zip: Collected data will be archived and compressed into a zip file. Additionally, you can create a password-protected zip file using the '--output-password' option ([#149](https://github.com/tclahr/uac/issues/149)).
- You can now set a custom output file name using the '-o/--output-base-name' command line option. Variables are available to format the filename ([#179](https://github.com/tclahr/uac/issues/179)).
- Now you have the option to supply a file path to a custom profile located outside the profiles directory.
- Now you have the option to supply a file path to a custom artifact located outside the artifacts directory ([#154](https://github.com/tclahr/uac/issues/154)).
- Now you can have the option to supply a file path to a custom config file located outside the config directory using the '-c/--config' command line option.
- New remote transfer options for Amazon, Google and IBM cloud storage locations.
- UAC will now use 'wget' to transfer files to remote cloud storage locations when 'curl' is not available.
- You can now increase the verbosity level using the '-v/--verbose' command line option. Enabling a higher verbosity level will result in the display of all executed commands.
- UAC will now use the built-in function 'astrings' to extract strings from binary files when 'strings' is not available on the system.
- The message 'The strings command requires the command line developer tools.' will no longer appear on macOS systems without developer tools installed ([#171](https://github.com/tclahr/uac/issues/171)).
- Error messages generated by executed commands (stderr) are now recorded in the uac.log file ([#150](https://github.com/tclahr/uac/issues/150)).
- New '-H/--hash-collected' command line option. Enabling this option will cause UAC to hash all collected files and save the results in a hash file. To accomplish this, all collected data must first be copied to the destination directory. Therefore, ensure you have twice the free space available on the system: once for the collected data and once for the output file. Additionally, note that this process will increase the running time ([#189](https://github.com/tclahr/uac/issues/189)).
- New '-t/--max-thread' command line option. It can be used to specify the number of files that will be processed in parallel by the 'hash' and 'stat' collectors.
- You can now validate profiles using the '--validate-profile' command line option.
